<h3 id="why-does-theotech-need-to-exist-">Why does TheoTech need to exist?</h3>
<p>Because opportunities to use technology to advance the gospel are so vast, it takes a company to deliver real and worthy results. A company is needed to align people’s interests and labor over the long term towards fulfilling Gospel-centered goals via invention.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-theotech-">What is TheoTech?</h3>
<p>It is a company that practices Technology Entrepreneurship for the Gospel (TE4G). It aspires to be earth’s most God-centered company by beginning with God as its foremost customer and creating products and experiences that fulfill His desires and bless the world.</p>
<h3 id="how-does-theotech-fulfill-its-purpose-">How does TheoTech fulfill its purpose?</h3>
<p><a href="#what-does-theotech-do-">See below</a> to read about what TheoTech does.
We look for virtuous cycles where investments of time and energy produce momentum towards kingdom outcomes. This means that we have leverage--more value is produced than consumed. Here is a sample flywheel for increasing personal prayer.</p>

<h3 id="what-could-happen-if-theotech-succeeds-and-is-it-worth-it-">What could happen if TheoTech succeeds and is it worth it?</h3>
<p>If TheoTech succeeds, its Kingdom investors will have more capital to invest in Kingdom outcomes, its employees and collaborators will be well provided for and overjoyed at the opportunity to use their gifts to advance the Gospel, and its customers will be blessed with products that help them to love God and one another. The side-effect of these outcomes is many joyful foretastes of the Kingdom of God enjoyed to the ends of the earth.</p>

<h3 id="why-does-a-new-for-profit-entity-to-need-to-exist-to-pursue-and-deliver-these-outcomes-">Why does a new for-profit entity to need to exist to pursue and deliver these outcomes?</h3>
<ol class="default">
    <li>
<strong>Aligning Incentives</strong>: Every stakeholder’s reward is linked to the common good and the corporation’s success in accomplishing its Gospel-centered purpose.
    </li>
    <li>
<strong>Accountability to the people we serve</strong>: There is a direct connection between delivering value to people and a thriving business. 
    </li>
    <li>
<strong>Being above reproach through transparency and honesty</strong>: There is no need to obscure a profit motive. Non-profits and for-profits alike need money to operate, but for-profits can be up-front about how they make money and how its business model benefits customers while achieving its mission.
    </li>
    <li>
<strong>Leadership &amp; Talent development</strong>: The pressures a for-profit company faces naturally introduces rigor into its operations. When stewarded well, this rigor develops a higher level of leadership and effectiveness.
    </li>
    <li>
<strong>Justice &amp; righteousness of rewards for taking responsibility</strong>: It is fitting for shrewd investors to get a good return, for hard workers to be rewarded for their labor, and for smart customers to continue to reap the benefits of their purchasing decisions. For profit companies that justly succeed enable shrewd investors to steward even more capital, hard workers to enjoy the fruits of their labor, and customers to continue getting more and more value.
    </li>
    <li>
<strong>Blessing the world through genuine commerce and value creation</strong>: A for profit company cannot justly survive unless it genuinely creates and delivers value, but if it does, we have a strong test of the blessing that it is.
    </li>

Economics is the study of how people love one another as they love themselves because it is the study of how value moves between people.
