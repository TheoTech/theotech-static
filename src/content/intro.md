## What do you do?

We believe technology should be developed and deployed to advance the most important cause of our time: getting the gospel to everyone on earth. We coined the term "Technology Entrepreneurship for the Gospel" to describe the movement. It means beginning with God as our ultimate customer and working backwards to create things that advance his interests and bless the world at large. We are unapologetically God obsessed and believe this obsession delivers immense value to people.

We want to develop people with this mindset by inventing products that create opportunities for them to unleash their gifts for the gospel.

			<td>We invent and simplify solutions to problems instead of relying on the status quo. We are always learning about and discovering new ways of doing things and cultivating the best ideas into real products and services.</td>
			<td>We take comprehensive responsibility for taking our ideas to customers so that our inventions deliver value to real people in a sustainable and profitable manner. We will try as many iterations as it takes, learn whatever we need to learn, suffer whatever risks we need to suffer and generally do whatever it takes in order to fulfill our mission.</td>
			<td>Everything we create is driven and measured by the values of God’s Kingdom and its contribution to the fulfillment of God’s will in the world. The solutions we deliver are shaped by the gospel and the conviction that no human creation can be a substitute for humanity’s ultimate need for God, but that all good things we make are to help people to hope in God and believe and obey his words.</td>
