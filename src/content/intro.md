## What do you do?
<p></p>

We dream of a world where state of the art technology is developed and deployed to advance the most important cause of our time: getting the gospel to everyone on earth. In a phrase, we dream of a movement of Technology Entrepreneurship for the Gospel. This means beginning with God as our ultimate customer and working backwards to create things that advance his interests and bless the world at large. We want to develop people with this mindset by inventing products that fit this pattern and creating the opportunities for them to unleash their gifts for the gospel.

The first product weâ€™ve built is Ceaseless, a Facebook app that helps believers pray for others. It turns out that if 10 million people pray for three friends each day, they could theoretically pray for every one of the 1.3 billion people on Facebook in less than a year. 

The second product is SPF.IO, a system that enables seamless multilingual experiences by showing people subtitles in real time on screen or on their mobile devices. 

The last product is an experimental speech recognition system being built for a ministry that wants to bring the Bible to the illiterate. The device enables people to navigate the Bible and hear it spoken to them in their native language.
