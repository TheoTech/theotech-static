We are hard at work forming:
<ol class="default">
	<li>A community of practice that helps and teaches one another.</li>
	<li>A network fostering connections between people so that ideas can have the backing of a team of people to make them real.</li>
	<li>Fostering in-person communities in technology companies so that entrepreneurs and technologies are able to pastor and support one another and think critically about how the work they do advances God’s kingdom and how they can imbue their work and workplace with the values of God’s kingdom.</li>
</ol>
