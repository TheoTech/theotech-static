<p>There is no doubt that software development and technological advancements have made life more connected and
    convenient. From the behemoth software companies like Microsoft, Facebook and Google to the small garage startups,
    new technologies and software ideas are being created, implemented, and tested. </p>
<p>So, what makes gospel-centered technologies so valuable and unique? At Theotech, everything we build, invent, and
    create is reversed engineered by a principle that God is our ultimate customer. </p>
<p>We canâ€™t accelerate the gospel on our own. It takes a community of technologists, entrepreneurs, and ministers to
    create ideas, build awesome stuff, and ultimately revolutionize the way we view technology.</p>
